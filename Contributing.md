# Contributing

I am open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community.

### Code Style

Please follow the [node style guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide).

### Commit Messages

Commit messages should be verb based, using the following pattern:

- `Fixing ...`
- `Adding ...`
- `Updating ...`
- `Removing ...`

### Features I'm working on:

- Pagination
- Display latest 10 search queries.
- Adding books to my bookshelf.
- Adding Google books authentication that allows users to log in and add books.
- Automating tests by using Jest.

### Note

The last commit is not deployed since I still work on pagination. After pagination is done, I should deploy.
